# Padi Wifi

Padinet Wifi Offering for Public Places

## Resto9 Goal

- Only guest can access wifi
- Give staffs limited access to wifi
- People in the parking lot can not access wifi

Guest is defined as someone who seats at the table and have an active order.

## User Experience

1. Guest opens laptop/mobile and sees a Resto9 QR code in her browser
2. Guest scans the QR code from her mobile
2. Padinet SMS gateway will send an access code to guest's mobile device (access_code)
3. Guest enter the access_code in her laptop/mobile to get Internet access

Admin feature:
- Intrusive daily usage report through email
- Admin control panel to monitor usage patterns and historical data

Nice side effects:
- If guest does not have QR code scanner in their phone, we direct them to download Padi App
- Usage pattern report can help detect whether staffs are using the guest wifi excessively

## Where to go from here?

Package this solution with marketing materials and offer to other restaurants/cafes/public places
